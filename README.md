* The intercept, ground clearance and vehicle length are variable/coefficients that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.
* The slope is not considered 0. The p-value is very small, and we can reject the null hypothesis. This means the relationships between the variable exist so the slope will not be 0.
* Yes, the linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototype. The adjusted R-square is 0.6825 which means there are about 68% of the variability of our dependent variable is explained using this linear model.

  From the analysis, we can see the overall variance of all lots is 62.3. Individually, lot 1 and lot 2 meet the expectation but the variance of lot 3 is 170.3 which is exceed the expectation.
